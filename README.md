# Project Title: 
Exploring Six Degrees of Separation in Twitter: A Scala-Based Big Data Analysis

# Objective:
The goal of this project is to investigate the concept of six degrees of separation using Twitter data. By analyzing the interconnectedness of Twitter users, we aim to understand how closely or distantly connected users are within the social network. 
Implement algorithms to calculate the shortest path between users in the Twitter graph.
Analyze the distribution of degrees of separation and identify key influencers or connectors within the network

# Tools and Technologies:
1) Scala
2) Apache Spark
3) Twitter API
