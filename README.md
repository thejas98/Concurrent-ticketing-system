## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Tools and Technologies:
1) Scala (built with 2.13.x)
2) Akka actors and Akka HTTP
3) Cassandra
4) Docker and Docker Compose
   
### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thejas98/Concurrent-ticketing-system.git
    cd concurrent-ticketing-system
    ```

2. Import the project into IntelliJ and make sure to have the scala plugin for IntelliJ.
3. Load the sbt Project using the sbt tool or the command line for sbt.

## Usage

### Running the Application

1. Before starting the application start the cassandra server by running the docker compose file using the command :
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```
3. Start the Http server by running the file called TicketAgencyApp.scala located at src/main/scala/com/csye7200/cts/app/TicketAgencyApp.scala.
4. Now you can use Postman or curl command from CMD to test that the server is up.


### API Endpoints

    - `POST /event`: Create a new event.
    - `GET /event/{eventId}`: Get details of a specific event.
    - `PUT /event/{eventId}`: Update an existing event.
    - `GET /events`: Get all events available.

- **Ticket Management:**
    - `POST /ticket`: Purchase tickets for an event.
    - `GET /ticket/{ticketId}`: Get details of a specific ticket.
    - `PUT /ticket/{ticketId}`: Cancel a purchased ticket.

- **Customer Management:**
    - `POST /customer`: Create a new customer.
    - `GET /customer/{customerId}`: Get details of a specific customer.
    - `GET /customers`: Get a list of all customers.
    - 

### Testing

All the testing is conducted using the Gatling tool. Gatling is a powerful load-testing solution for applications, APIs, and microservices.

Refer to the following document to see a list of all test cases with decriptions and expected result.

#### Unit Tests

1. To run the unit tests for the application, run the following command from the root directory:
   ```bash
   sbt Gatling/test
   ```
3. After running the above line, a report gets generated under `'target/Gatling'`. Each folder under this directory represents one run of the test case. You can open the `index.html` file under any one report folder to see the report in pdf.
   

#### Integration and Performance Testing

1. To run the testing for heavy loads of 1000+ concurrent users, we have prepared two test files:
   - HeavyLoadTesting : Create 1000+ Events and customers.
   - HeavyLoadTestingBookingTickets: Book 1000+ tickets for 1000+ customers for a specific event.
2. To run the above test cases, use the following format to run:
   ```bash
   sbt 'GatlingIt/testOnly com.csye7200.cts.HeavyLoadTesting'
   ```



Note: All the test cases are documents in the testcases.csv file located in the root directory.
